The IPL Score Predictor is a machine learning-based project that forecasts the probable score of a team in an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket match based on various match parameters.
It uses historical match data and important features like team composition, overs played, wickets lost, current run rate, venue, pitch conditions, and opposition strength.
